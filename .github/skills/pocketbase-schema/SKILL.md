# PocketBase Schema

Tooling for authoring, inspecting, and validating PocketBase schema migrations. For server lifecycle operations (init, dev, stop, reset), see the **pocketbase** skill.

## Prerequisites

- PocketBase project already initialized (via `pocketbase` skill's **PB Init**)
- Go 1.23+ installed and on PATH
- For **Inspect**: PocketBase server must be running (via `pb-dev.sh` or `pb-reset.sh`)

## Operations

| Operation | Script | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Migrate Create** | `bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-migrate-create.sh <description> [type]` | Generate a timestamped migration file with boilerplate |
| **Schema Inspect** | `bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-inspect.sh [collection-name]` | Dump live schema as JSON (all collections or one) |
| **Schema Validate** | `bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-validate.sh` | Wipe data and dry-run all migrations to check for errors |

### Migrate Create

Generates a new migration file in `pb/pb_migrations/` with the correct timestamp and boilerplate.

```bash
# Create a new collection
bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-migrate-create.sh create_posts create

# Modify an existing collection
bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-migrate-create.sh add_featured_to_posts modify

# Seed data into a collection
bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-migrate-create.sh seed_categories seed
```

The `type` argument selects the boilerplate template:
- **`create`** (default): `new Collection(...)` skeleton with commented field examples
- **`modify`**: `findCollectionByNameOrId()` skeleton with add/remove/modify examples
- **`seed`**: Record insertion skeleton

After generating, edit the file to fill in collection name and fields.

### Schema Inspect

Requires the server to be running.

```bash
# Dump all collections
bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-inspect.sh

# Dump a specific collection
bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-inspect.sh posts
```

### Schema Validate

Stops the server, wipes `pb_data`, and runs all migrations to check for errors. Does NOT restart the server — run `pb-reset.sh` or `pb-dev.sh` afterward.

```bash
bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-validate.sh
```

## Workflow

Follow this loop when adding or modifying collections:

1. **Inspect** current schema to understand what exists
   ```bash
   bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-inspect.sh
   ```
2. **Generate** a migration boilerplate
   ```bash
   bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-migrate-create.sh create_posts create
   ```
3. **Edit** the generated file — fill in collection name, fields, rules, and indexes
4. **Validate** — dry-run all migrations to catch errors
   ```bash
   bash .github/skills/pocketbase-schema/scripts/pb-schema-validate.sh
   ```
5. **Reset & verify** — start fresh server and check admin dashboard
   ```bash
   bash .github/skills/pocketbase/scripts/pb-reset.sh
   ```

## Migration Authoring Rules

These rules prevent the most common agent mistakes. Follow them strictly.

### Relations: Always Look Up Collection IDs

**Never** hardcode a `collectionId`. Always resolve it at migration time:

```javascript
migrate((app) => {
  const users = app.findCollectionByNameOrId("users")

  const collection = new Collection({
    name: "posts",
    type: "base",
    fields: [
      new RelationField({
        name: "author",
        collectionId: users.id,     // CORRECT: resolved at runtime
        maxSelect: 1,
        cascadeDelete: false,
      }),
    ],
  })
  app.save(collection)
})
```

### Migration Ordering

- Files run in **filename order** (lexicographic by timestamp prefix)
- A migration that references another collection must come **after** the migration that creates it
- Use `pb-migrate-create.sh` to get correct timestamps — do NOT manually set timestamps

### Always Write DOWN Migrations

Every `migrate()` call takes two callbacks: UP and DOWN. Always implement both:

```javascript
migrate((app) => {
  // UP: create or modify
}, (app) => {
  // DOWN: reverse the UP changes
})
```

### Auth Collections

Auth collections get system fields automatically (`email`, `emailVisibility`, `verified`, `password`, `tokenKey`). Do not re-declare them. Only add your custom fields:

```javascript
const collection = new Collection({
  type: "auth",
  name: "users",
  fields: [
    new TextField({ name: "displayName", max: 100 }),
    // email, password, etc. are added automatically
  ],
  passwordAuth: { enabled: true },
})
```

### View Collections

View collections are read-only and backed by a SQL SELECT:

```javascript
const collection = new Collection({
  type: "view",
  name: "posts_with_authors",
  viewQuery: "SELECT p.id, p.title, u.displayName as author FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.author = u.id",
  // listRule / viewRule apply; create/update/delete rules are ignored
})
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hardcoded `collectionId: "abc123"` | Use `app.findCollectionByNameOrId("name").id` |
| Migration references a collection that doesn't exist yet | Ensure the creating migration has an earlier timestamp |
| Re-declaring `email`, `password` on auth collections | These are system fields — they exist automatically |
| Missing DOWN migration | Always implement the second callback to `migrate()` |
| Using `$app` instead of `app` | The callback parameter is `app`, not `$app` |
| Setting rules to `undefined` or omitting them | Use `null` (superuser only), `""` (public), or a filter string |
| `new Field(...)` instead of `new TextField(...)` | Use the specific constructor: `TextField`, `NumberField`, etc. |
| Manually naming migration files | Always use `pb-migrate-create.sh` for correct timestamps |
